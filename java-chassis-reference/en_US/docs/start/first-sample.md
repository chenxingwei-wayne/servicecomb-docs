# Develop the first microservice

Before you start, developers need to choose a familiar development method. There are currently 3 ways to choose:
* Spring MVC
* JaxRS
* RPC

Developers can quickly build a project in following ways:

* Download the samples project. [servicecomb-samples](https://github.com/apache/servicecomb-samples) provides many samples in hand.

  * [Spring MVC Sample](https://github.com/apache/servicecomb-samples/tree/master/java-chassis-samples/springmvc-sample)
  * [JaxRS Sample](https://github.com/apache/servicecomb-samples/tree/master/java-chassis-samples/jaxrs-sample)
  * [POJO Sample](https://github.com/apache/servicecomb-samples/tree/master/java-chassis-samples/pojo-sample)

* Generate projects using archetypes

  Maven provide archetypes to generate projects. Java-chassis implements many types of archetypes, see [LINK](https://github.com/apache/servicecomb-java-chassis/tree/master/archetypes) for details.

* Generate projects using ServiceComb Spring Initializer

  ServiceComb Spring Initializer is an graphic user interface to generate projects. See [LINK](http://start.servicecomb.io/)
